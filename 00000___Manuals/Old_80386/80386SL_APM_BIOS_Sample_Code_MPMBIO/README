                Section 1 : What is in those files (APM BIOS)


Section 1 :

1. LOADAPM.ASM :

      It can do following things...

        a) If no switches are specified or /d is specified as a switch then
it will load the APM Power Management code onto System Management RAM and
and then enables it. It also initializes the Power Management timers and 
several other related registers.

        b) If an invalid or /h switch is given on the command line then 
the program will print spit out the help menu onto the screen.

      Tip to the user : If you specify an invalid switch or /h then please
observe that the message at the end tells the user that Power Management 
is not loaded. IN REALITY IT EVEN DISABLES ANY PREVIOUSLY LOADED 
POWER MANAGEMENT..So you can effectively use this technique to disable 
and STOP power management any time you want. Like editing you code or
stuff like that. 

       c) If you specify /b as the command switch this version of load
program does unique tricks. It loads the whole load program along with
INT15 extension and INIT routines to shadow RAM at 0E000:0 with proper
signature and checksums..and will prompt you to SOFT-BOOT the machine.
When you do that the ROM_SEARCH routines of standard BIOS will install
APM compatible BIOS as an OPTIONAL PLUGGABLE AT ROM. So INIT routines
gain control and initialize and enable POWER MANAGEMENT. It allows the
user to HAVE POWER MANAGEMENT installed at the time of MSDOS LOADING so
any installable drivers can take advantage of it...

    Note : Please note that this technique allows Intel Corp. to upgrade
BIOS ROUTINES with out any need to ship ROM BIOS CHIPS but only by
sending soft files INIT.SYS and INT15.SYS and APM.SYS


2. APMI.ASM : The real core program that sits in SM RAM at SMI VECTOR
and does all Power Management. 

Note : This file is not MSDOS executable.

3. INT15.ASM : Extension APM services for the existing standard BIOS
INT15 driver..

Note : This file is not MSDOS executable.

4. INIT.ASM  : Has all the code to interface with ROM_SEARCH utilities
of a standard AT compatible BIOS...Loads all the stuff to proper  places..

Note : This file is not MSDOS executable.

5. REG_EQU.INC : Holy book of equates.

6. PWRMN.MAC   : My handy tool kit...
