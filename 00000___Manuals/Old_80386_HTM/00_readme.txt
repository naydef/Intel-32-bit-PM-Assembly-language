Intel 80386 Programmer's Reference Manual HTML translation -- 0.9 version

I translated this document in html format because I think it is a good
source of information, and it seemed to me that its original .txt format
wasn't very handy to consult.
In addiction I thought it would have been a useful way to practice
unix shell programming.
I produced these files with bash, awk, sed under Linux, and a bit of
C to build the figures.
If you are interested in something concerning the way all this has been
done, drop me a line.

I produced most of this stuff with automatic, "ad hoc" tools, but it has
been necessary a lot of human "debugging". Still, I'm sure that there is
some particular to refine.
I'll be grateful to everyone that will send to me a beta-report.

A lot of inter-page linking has to be done again, but maybe it is better
to wait for a definitively "error free" version.
