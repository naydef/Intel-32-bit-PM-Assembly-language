This is the library designed for...
#           GDT Descriptors generating in 16-bit Real-Address Mode ( MASM5.00 Syntaxed Version )

Calling Convention is __stdcall

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
if you want to re-test my build file, following steps can give you help:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
---> ensure you have upzipped the MASM Kit file in the the specific folder
	such as the MASM.EXE located in \masm5\masm.exe

--> To get the *.obj file, type this:                           \masm5\MASM.EXE test.asm;

--> To get the linked COFF-formatting *.exe file, type this:    \masm5\LINK.EXE test.obj;

	Further purpose for using it as a routine, used by NASM( Intel-Like-Syntax ),
			but maybe re-write it into GAS( AT&T-Syntax)
