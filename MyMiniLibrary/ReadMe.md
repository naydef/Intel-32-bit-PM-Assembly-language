This folder is used for building Library Codes

Strictly speaking, some of the codes are copied from others,
if so, I will honestly write its original author's name as well as Email,
even if it is a open-source pattern.

Tips:
type this in your source code in  /32-bit-PM-Assembly-language/XXXXXXXX

					%include "..\MyMiniLibrary\XXXXX"

".." represents in the upper-layer folder or directory
XXXXX can be replaced to any file you want to use.
