# Read Floppy Sector in 16-bit  -- NASM syntax

	When the boot sector is out of Bootstrap's maximum size of
		512 Bytes,

	I was lost in desperation...
	And you ?
		
Are you like being at the mercy of limitation ?

If NO, ...

_RM_read_floppy_data2memory.asm gives your technical support.
 
##By calling this module in real mode, read LBA Sector
will satisfy your requirement.

Have fun ~
