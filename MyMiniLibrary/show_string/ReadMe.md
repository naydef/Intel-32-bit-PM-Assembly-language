## 	"show_string" routine

# Description:
Sometimes debug is a really hard stuff.

Most possibly, inserted statement block 
may lead to your puzzle of understanding 
the deliberate of the program.

I hope I can free from this problem by this routine.

16-bit as well as 32-bit included accordingly,
it is up to you.

# !! Caution !!!
!! For lacking of time, this is not tested.
!! Test it first and then you can put it into your codes.
