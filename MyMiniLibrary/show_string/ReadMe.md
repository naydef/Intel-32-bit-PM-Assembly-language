## 	"show_string" routine  -- Using NASM syntax

# Description:
Sometimes debug is a really hard stuff.

Most possibly, inserted statement block 
may lead to your puzzle of understanding 
the deliberate of the program.

I hope I can free from this problem by this routine.

16-bit as well as 32-bit included accordingly,
it is up to you.

# In the "/MyMiniLibrary/show_string/test" directory,
All the test file are stored as a ASM file and a PNG photo file.
