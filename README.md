##  32-bit Protected Mode Assembly language

Currently, my CPU is "Pentium(R) Dual-Core CPU E5200", a 64-bit CPU.

But all the program here will be compatible to
the oldest version of Pentium series,
which is published on March 22, 1993,
whose name is "Intel(R) Pentium" 

#  For those who become crazy due to Assembly Programming Language

Have Fun~!
